The reason why I choose this for my final project, was because I wanted something my kids could play and say I help make this game. It had reminded me of a smiliar game I use to play as a kid. 
  
What I would do differently next time, would be to do more research on how to add a battle function. But I really enjoyed my time making this in 1 week time frame. I learnt a lot from working on this, this helped solidify what we have been learning for the last 8 weeks like react and redux.

I also learned a new frame work aswell (charka ui) for this group project. I had to spend one of my nights to do reseacrh on charka ui but ended up finding out how to style our nav bar with a gradiant colour.
